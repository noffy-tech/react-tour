Product tours help with onboarding users to new and complex UX and helps to get users familiar with UI functionalities. Theyâ€™re also useful for showcasing new updates on product UI, and they can save time for the customer success team. It has very nice UI if you need a simple product tour without much customization. If this is the case, React Tour UI will be good enough.You can view the demo for React Tour here.

## How it work.

With React Tour, you pass the classname or id selector and content for each step to the component.
It will render the tour UI based on a button click, or after mounting the component. Itâ€™s simple for static pages and UI:

```
const steps = [
  {
    selector: '.tour-first-step',
    content: 'This is the first Step',
  },
  {
    selector: '.tour-second-step',
    content: 'This is the second Step',
  }
  // ...
]
```

## Letâ€™s create the simple product tour component:

create a common component for react tour to use dynamically in your project. `common/ReactTour/ReactTour.jsx`

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Tour from "reactour";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

function ReactTour({ steps }) {
  // Default open
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(true);
  // Close React Tour
  const onClose = async () => {
    setVisible(false);
  };
  return <Tour steps={steps} isOpen={visible} onRequestClose={onClose} />;
}

ReactTour.propTypes = {
  steps: PropTypes.object,
};

export default ReactTour;
```

Now, import this common ReactTour component into the `App.js`

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import ReactTour from "./common/ReactTour";
import logo from "./logo.svg";
import "./App.css";

function App() {
  // To check visibility
  const [reactTour, setReactTour] = useState(true);
  // This are the steps
  const steps = [
    {
      selector: ".App-logo", // This is selector. It can be Id or class.
      content: function Component() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h3>
              <strong>Logo</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>

          </div>
        ); // In the return() you can create user interface.
      },
    },
    {
      selector: ".App-link",
      content: function Component() {
        return (
          <div>
            <h3>
              <strong>Learn React</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>

          </div>
        );
      },
    },
  ];
  function closeReactTour() {
    setReactTour(false);
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {reactTour ? (
        <ReactTour steps={steps} successFunc={closeReactTour} />
      ) : null}
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >

        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
